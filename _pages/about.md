<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

My name is **Bo Peng (彭博)**, and I hold a PhD in civil engineering from [NYU Abu Dhabi](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/). Alongside my doctoral studies, I earned a second master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning from [Georgia Tech's OMSCS program](https://omscs.gatech.edu/). 

I am passionate about computer graphics, particularly in geometry modeling and processing. My research experience also encompasses computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning. This blog serves as a platform to share and document the insights and knowledge I've gained throughout my academic and research journey. My lifelong ambition is to contribute to the convergence of engineering, computer science, and emerging technologies.
